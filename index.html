<h1>cicada</h1>
<p><h2>Cicadas have prominent eyes set wide apart, short antennae, and membranous front wings. They have an exceptionally loud song, produced in most species by the rapid buckling and unbuckling of drumlike tymbals. The earliest known fossil Cicadomorpha appeared in the Upper Permian period; extant species occur all around the world in temperate to tropical climates. They typically live in trees, feeding on watery sap from xylem tissue, and laying their eggs in a slit in the bark. Most cicadas are cryptic. </h2></p>

<h1>chameleon</h1>
<p><h2>Most chameleons have a prehensile tail that they use to wrap around tree branches. Their hands and feet have large toes that help them cling to branches. ... Chameleons have a full 360-degree view and can focus their eyes quickly and enlarge what they are looking at like a camera lens</h2></p>

<p><h2>Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back. There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian camels, which have two humps. ... Sand up the nose can be a problem, but not for camels. They can shut their nostrils during sand storms.</h2></p>
